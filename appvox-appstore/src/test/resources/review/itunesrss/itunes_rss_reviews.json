I clicked on a few of each which was enough so I clicked on that I wasn’t interested. The articles kept showing up, sometimes multiple articles every time I opened Google. Just now I opened the app and, out of 37 articles, 5 were about Charlene!! I keep saying I’m not interested but I keep seeing these articles. Enough already!!!  Another annoying bug is that, when Google is refreshing the articles, if you’re reading one, it freezes and you have to exit Google, reopen it and go to Tabs to find and continue reading the article.",

For example -I search something like “candy” and then on the results that come up there is an overview of the subject searched. Then there is a blue box that pops up and points to that overview button and says “tap here for summary and general info”. I’m not understanding why Google has to define/explain this button every time I search something. I know what overview means. Or I look up a restaurant and a box forms over the “order here” button on the result page and says “view menu and order food.” If these instructional pop ups only occurred once when I first used Google I would understand but every time I search something there are blue boxes all over the page speaking to me like I am dumb lol. Soooo unnecessary and so annoying. Trying to find a way to disable this but no one can give me any info. I’ve tweeted at them and they don’t answer, I’ve called apple who says it’s Google’s issue but no one cares. Have stopped using Google because of how annoying it is.",

Not only does it fail to identify the tune, it never even gave a guess or acknowledged that it couldn’t find it or suggested other things to try - its dots bounced along with the sounds (so I know the audio was active) but then would just quit listening and return to home with no feedback. We then gave several tests using humming, whistling, and singing along simple Christmas tunes to see if we could get it to work. I’m no virtuoso but, from the examples shown in all the Google ads, I think it should have given me something in all the tests we tried. Only once did it give me 3 very wrong guesses for a Jingle Bells whistle rendition. All other tests only resulted in no feedback at all. If you make any sounds it interprets as words (“la la la” or “blah blah blah”), it goes straight to lyrics that are ridiculously unhelpful and ignore any tune analysis. Maybe I’m missing a prompt or a trick to get it to work but I’ve determined the ads must be straight-up fiction and false.",

I downloaded the app to use the “hum a song” feature anyways, yet when I first opened the app, the button that you are supposed to use for that feature didn’t show up. I closed the app for a few minutes and opened it back up to finally see the button, but google assistant seemed to have lost the ability to understand Japanese and would make my words into unreadable English “sentences”. After trying to fix it for 10 minutes I gave up and decided to make sure the “hum a song” feature was actually working. The circle of colorful dots showed up on the screen and moved when I hummed but nothing happened and after waiting for a few seconds, it would close and show the normal google assistant pop-up at the bottom of the screen. As if I hadn’t pressed the “search a song” button at all. Very disappointed.",

After some searching I found out that it’s about 1700 miles, so why is google telling me that a website, with incorrect information is right? Shouldn’t there be a algorithm or maybe a fact checker that would make sure that your actually giving people correct information? It is absolutely unacceptable that Google, a place where people get there information from everyday, is giving people the wrong information. What other questions do I have wrong answers to because of this. It would be great if when I asked google something it didn’t tell me what might be the answer, I would rather make the mistake myself of clicking on a not so trusted website and getting wrong information there rather than google straight up lying to me.",

I would often find features that were on safari that weren’t on google or didn't work as smoothly, such as the transition from incognito to regular browsing or simply going back and going forward while searching. If I went back too far google would send me to the original search screen with no way of going back to what I was  just looking at. These, amongst other things, are minor, but they add up in the long run to make the users experience horrid. However, the google chrome app is a different story, it’s nearly identical to safari and in many ways better than it.",

Going to have to rate a 1 star and uninstall the app for faulty software and false advertising. Unfortunate considering this is a cool idea but it seems to have been executed very poorly. I would suggest actually putting a button there instead of lying to your users, and making it so when I say “What’s this song” it performs the actual advertised feature instead of taking me to a google search. Seems like a simple and obvious fix. Hopefully you all can get back to me and let me know if I’m doing something wrong, if the song search button is hidden somewhere strange in the app, or if the programming is just completely inept.",

If I'm not interested in sports, it shouldn't take weeks of removing every article related to sports to finally be removed. Most of the times a few articles will display and going to the next page just results in \" something went wrong \". I love this app but it's the most frustrating one I have installed. Reinstallation does not fix the issue. Lastly if I do a random search I now have to open chrome private browsing because this app will \"think\" I'm interested in whatever I searched for, thus starting the loop cycle of trying to remove articles I'm not interested in, all from one random search.",

What happened, though, was that the text in the screen was highly zoomed, and locked in place, making it impossible to scroll, in any direction, to wherever it was on the screen that I was supposed to do the next thing.  Until that bug gets fixed, obviously, the Google App two-step login option is dead.\n\nAs for the app itself, it seems to be a decent search engine with some additional features.",

I will click on the icon and I will tap the camera on the profile picture and it will say \"you can't change this profile picture from this account\" but the problem is I have before. Also I've had this song stuck in my head so I tried to use the \"find song\" feature on the app and when I tap on it the dots will show up for a few seconds, like its trying to find the song, then it will go back to the home page. It is getting really annoying and I'm about ready to quit using the app (even though I liked using it) if these problems continue.",

Clearly, just holding on the notifications you don’t want and turning them off that way was too convenient for users, and led to too much getting turned off that google didn’t want.

It shows that it works, as the red line is moving around the circle, however the video does not actually take. I have seen a couple times at the top of my screen “Touch to return to Snapchat” or “Hangouts” but even after I have closed these apps it still fails to work and says the same thing. Afterwards when I try to take a video without moving the animal, it doesn’t take either! I have to close and open the app again, or exit out of 3-D in order to get a working video. But I’m still unable to move the animal around or the whole process will repeat. I’m not sure if it’s the same for other animals or not, but regardless, please fix this!",

What happened to the google lens option that WAS right next to the microphone in the search bar?? I used it for only a couple of things and when I went to use it again within 24 hours it was GONE. I’ve gone through everything within the app and there’s a place to download it and that didn’t even work. In one place it talks about the lens but again, it’s not on there. I’ve uninstalled the app and when I go back to the App Store to reinstall it, it says to update it. But I uninstalled it so why is it only giving option to update it instead of install it. And when I go to App Store and look at all the app offers, it shows that you can use google lens to search stuff you see, BUT IT’S NOT THERE WHEN I’M IN THE APP ITSELF. What’s the deal google? Where is the lens????? Please help me with this??!!!!",

I spoke to the New York Times x2 and both times they said it was a third-party (Google Pay issue). The fact that I can’t contact them directly it’s really bad. The account information that I received in my email doesn’t work when I enter it into their form. Don’t trust this app!

But now, not only is the text required but am unable go full screen with an image (and hide the text when tapping on it or rotating my phone). This is awful for viewing images because phone screens are not that big and now it only shows up on half the screen.

I’ve tried it on multiple different wifi networks, using data in various locations, force quit the app and restarted, to no avail. I’ll then go search the same thing on the Safari app and it’ll immediately load. So I’m inclined to think that it’s a problem with the app’s functionality, not user error. The next day or so it’ll start functioning properly, only to go back to being broken again. It was convenient, but now it’s just infuriating",

It’s not what articles are popping up in my feed, it’s a persistent weekly score bubble under my google search bar at the very top of my discovery feed. I have went through all the options & requested that no Tampa Bay Bucs news specifically be added to my feed. It has remained. Update #2: It’s actually the latest team news feed for the Bucs.

They took away the connectivity to Apple Maps. Why? This was one of the main features I used the app for. I would look up Applebee’s, click for directions, and google would reroute me right to Apple Maps with the right directions. Now Apple Maps is no longer an option and it’s obvious you took away this feature without stating that’s what you were going to do in the update which in my mind is a really shady business practice and let’s me know you knew doing this would make some people mad. \n\n2. Symbols on the images. Now users can’t screenshot or view images without seeing the buttons/symbols. Again, another feature I used a lot that was taken away. \n\n3. When you click on a suggested image when viewing an image, they is no way to go back to that original image without going back all the image results. Why is there no back button?\n\nPlease add back these features to earn a good review! Thanks to these exact features, I think I’m going to have to start using Safari app just for the Apple connectivity and to view images without the three or four buttons on top each of them.",

The Share button is now where the Bookmark button was, which is now where the Refresh button was, which is just gone for some reason. Also they got rid of the back button in the top left that allowed you to go back from the Open-in-new-tabesque feature, which is a major inconvenience to be honest. Overall not happy with it.

I wouldn’t even think twice about downloading this app again if it incorporated just 1 specific thing... the first is that I wish this app had a reverse image search feature similar to Pinterest’s. Google already has a reverse image search option for non-mobile users (PC, Mac, etc.) in the browser, but the Google app doesn’t have this function for mobile use. So I would think that a reverse image search right on your mobile device would be brilliant. I would probably delete my Pinterest app if the Google app had this function.",

Most times I just give up and click open page in Safari so I don’t have deal with it. Its also slightly annoying because it never goes away and I don’t see an option to close it. The only time it goes away is when I scroll up which does me no good if I want to look at the very bottom of the page. It would be much better if it was hidden at the top of the screen and I can just swipe down if I want to see it. At least give an option to close the box.",

Scrolling through saved item collections is impossibly laggy, with several seconds elapsing between a touch or drag and the app responding — when it does scroll, it stutters and freezes.\n\nI have a top-tier current-gen iPad Pro with 70% of internal storage available, and would hope Google values stability and performance over feature-adds that aren’t ready for public release.\n\nPlease fix this, Google: an app that is fragile and unreliable is an app uninstalled.

If you search for an establishment and the result you click is a yelp website, the Google app doesn't take you to the information you want.  Instead you get a series of links and you have to reenter the search on the yelp app. There's obviously a better way, and things could be more seamless.\n\nThese have been long running problems and I'm surprised Google isn't on top of this.

I loved the Google app and have been using it religiously as my search engine for 5+ years. There have been many changes since I first started using the app, mostly good, but some bad. I use google a lot for reference images for art and now you can no longer save pictures directly from images. It was bad enough you took away the image previews, and then changed the way you save photos, but now you can’t even save them! It sends you to the website, but for many things on mobile it either doesn’t work or forces you to sign into a website to get to the photo. Sometimes it will take you to a website that just doesn’t even work! I will probably stop using the Google app after today and switch to another unless you fix this. It makes the app unusable for me.",

I know it’s not just my phone being slow because I am able to write this review without the problem and text at my normal speed in iMessages and other apps with no issues. \n\nAdditionally, the search results seem to take longer to appear. The app hangs and freezes from time to time. Websites are opening slowly, and stay blank for a while before opening or not at all. When I’m scrolling down a page it does not scroll smoothly, rather there are pauses and it lags behind. I thought the most recent update would fix the problem but it hasn’t. \n\nThe actual search content wise is good but there are too many “related searches” and “related search results” displayed and not enough actual results displayed on the small screen. It usually shows about 10-12 results, and then a list of 8 related searches and results for potential searches. That ratio is too close and there should be more actual search results. \n\nPlease fix this.",
